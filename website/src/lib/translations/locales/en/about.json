We are a cooperative and the operation is democratically run by the members of the association through membership meetings and various working groups. Our purpose is not to generate profit, but rather to meet the common interest of the members for organic, fair and locally produced food and other daily goods, and to be able to offer this at a good price. We also want to highlight local small scale producers and spread knowledge about and encourage a sustainable lifestyle.",

Active members manage the daily operation of Ekolivs. In addition to keeping the store open, members are organized in four working groups:",
